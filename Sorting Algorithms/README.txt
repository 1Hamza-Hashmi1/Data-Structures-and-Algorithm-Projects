Implements merge sort. Outputs the sorted array as well as the metrics for that specific sort.


2)
Insertion Sort:
Best Case: O(n). Comparisons = n - 1, Swaps = 0, Copys = n - 1
Average Case: O(n^2). Comparisons = n^2 - 1, Swaps = (n(n-1))/2 , Copys = n - 1
Worst Case: O(n^2). Comparisons = n^2 - 1, Swaps = (n(n-1))/2 , Copys = n - 1


Merge Sort:
Best Case: O(nlogn). Comparisons = Swaps = Copys = nlogn
Average Case: O(nlogn). Comparisons = Swaps = Copys = nlogn
Worst Case: O(nlogn). Comparisons = Swaps = Copys = nlogn
