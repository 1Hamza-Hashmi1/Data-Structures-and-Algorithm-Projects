To solve any variation of Towers of Hanoi, the towersMain file is used.

The code in the towersMain implements a recursive algorithm to solve the towers.

All the requirments specified in the lab maual were achived through the use of if and else if statemts found in the towersMain file. 

For no args, type towers.
For 1 arg, type towers 1.
for 4 arges, type towers 1 2 3.


Question 1:

1.When towers() is invoked, the first recursive will be towers(4,2,1)

2.5 recursive calss to towers() will be made before it returns to the inital invocation

3.The move done made by towers(5,2,3) will have the 1st disk from the stack move from tower 2 to tower 3

4.When towers() is invoked, the first recursive will be towers(0,3,2)


Question 2:

1)If towers(8,1,2) is invoked, the program will output 255 lines.
